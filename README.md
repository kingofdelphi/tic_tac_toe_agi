# Tic tac toe - the RECIPE for AGI

I create an AI that learns to get better any Adversary that you can create. 

The AI learns during self play. No extra training data required except coding of an Adversary.

The interesting part is that after some episodes of evolution of the AI, we can extract out the AI itself
and use it as an adversary
